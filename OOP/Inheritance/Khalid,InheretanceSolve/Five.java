/* 
 * Write a Java program to create a class known as "BankAccount" with methods called 
deposit() and withdraw(). Create a subclass called SavingsAccount that overrides the 
withdraw() method to prevent withdrawals if the account balance falls below one 
hundred. 
Expected Output: 
Current balance: $500.0 
Deposited: $200.0 
Current balance: $700.0 
Withdrew: $550.0 
Current balance: $150.0 
Withdrawal denied: Balance cannot fall below $100 
Current balance: $150.0
